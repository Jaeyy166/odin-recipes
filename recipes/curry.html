	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast, or more to taste</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed</li>
		<li>5 ⅓ cups water, divided</li>
		<li>1 (7.75 ounce) package curry sauce mix (such as S&B® Golden Curry®)</li>
		<li>1 (15 ounce) can peas, drained</li>
		<li>5 new potatoes, halved</li>
		<li>1 (8 ounce) package sliced cremini mushrooms</li>
		<li>2 medium carrots, chopped</li>
		<li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
		<li>2 cups jasmine rice (such as Mahatma®) or just any available rice in your home</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<h2>Steps:</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Place chicken in a large, deep skillet. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper on both sides. Add 1/3 cup water to the pan, cover, and cook over medium heat until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes.</li>
		<li>While chicken is cooking, pour 2 cups water into a microwave-safe bowl. Break curry sauce mix into pieces and add to water. Heat in the microwave on high for 3 1/2 minutes; remove and stir until sauce mix has completely dissolved.</li>
		<li>Remove chicken from the skillet. Cut into cubes, return to the skillet, and pour curry sauce over top. Stir in peas, potatoes, mushrooms, carrots, and onion. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
		<li>Meanwhile, bring remaining water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
		<li>Scoop rice into bowls and serve curry on top.</li>
	</ol>
